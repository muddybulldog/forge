# theforge

A token-efficient development flow for Claude Code. Personal fork of
[superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) v5.1.0, rebuilt for current
models and harness capabilities — roughly the same discipline at a fraction of
the token cost.

## The flow

**Brainstorm → spec → plan → implement**, with approval gates between each stage.
The flow operates in three gears: trivial edits bypass it entirely; changes to an already-specified system take a lightweight conversational gate straight to TDD (gear 2); new architecture invokes the full brainstorm → spec → plan → execute sequence (gear 3).
Brainstorming turns an idea into a user-reviewed spec (`docs/theforge/specs/`), drawing first-class input from `docs/theforge/ideas/` docs.
Specs are living documents: amendments are made in place and logged with a dated changelog entry.
Planning turns the spec into a plan of *what and where* — files, interfaces, test
cases, acceptance criteria, never implementation code (`docs/theforge/plans/`).
Execution runs task-by-task with strict TDD, inline for small plans or via a
Workflow for large ones, with review proportional to risk. A project-memory layer
(`ROADMAP.md`, `DECISIONS.md`, `DEFERRALS.md`) keeps durable context across
sessions: decisions are read before feature builds; agents may defer non-spec
scope but must log why.

## Skills

| Skill | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `brainstorming` | Gear routing, then idea → validated design → spec through batched-question dialogue. Includes the browser-based visual companion for mockups. |
| `planning` | Spec → implementation plan (what/where, no code) → execution. |
| `tdd` | Red-green-refactor discipline, cut to its operational core. |
| `project-memory` | Formats and rules for ROADMAP / DECISIONS / DEFERRALS. |

## Hooks

One conditional `SessionStart` hook: injects ~60 words of flow context, but only
in repos that use the flow (`docs/theforge/` or `.theforge/` exists). Everywhere
else it emits nothing. Skill discovery doesn't depend on it — frontmatter
descriptions handle that in every session.

## Install

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add forcetrainer/theforge
claude plugin install theforge@theforge
```

To update later: `claude plugin update theforge@theforge` (or `git pull` in a
local clone).

## Developing (editing skills)

On the machine where you edit the plugin, point the marketplace at your working
copy instead of GitHub so edits are picked up locally:

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add ~/development/theforge
```

The plugin cache only re-syncs on a **version bump**. After editing anything
under `skills/`, `agents/`, or `hooks/`:

```bash
# 1. bump "version" in .claude-plugin/plugin.json
# 2. then:
claude plugin update theforge@theforge
# 3. restart the session to apply
```

This repo dogfoods its own conventions: design decisions are logged in
`docs/theforge/DECISIONS.md` (read it before changing skill behavior) and
consciously-skipped work in `docs/theforge/DEFERRALS.md`. The presence of
`docs/theforge/` also opts this repo into its own session hook.

## What was cut from superpowers and why

See `docs/notes/superpowers-assessment.md` — the full skill-by-skill assessment.
Headlines: plans no longer embed implementation code (the single biggest token
sink), per-task review is proportional instead of three agents per task, and the
800-word every-session hook injection is gone.
