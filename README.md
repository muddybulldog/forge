# theforge

A token-efficient development flow for Claude Code. Personal fork of
[superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) v5.1.0, rebuilt for current
models and harness capabilities — roughly the same discipline at a fraction of
the token cost.

## The flow

**Brainstorm → spec → plan → implement**, with approval gates between each stage.
Brainstorming turns an idea into a user-reviewed spec (`docs/theforge/specs/`).
Planning turns the spec into a plan of *what and where* — files, interfaces, test
cases, acceptance criteria, never implementation code (`docs/theforge/plans/`).
Execution runs task-by-task with strict TDD, inline for small plans or via a
Workflow for large ones, with review proportional to risk. A project-memory layer
(`ROADMAP.md`, `DECISIONS.md`, `DEFERRALS.md`) keeps durable context across
sessions: decisions are read before feature builds; agents may defer non-spec
scope but must log why.

## Skills

| Skill | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `brainstorming` | Idea → validated design → spec, through one-question-at-a-time dialogue. Includes the browser-based visual companion for mockups. |
| `planning` | Spec → implementation plan (what/where, no code) → execution. |
| `tdd` | Red-green-refactor discipline, kept nearly verbatim from superpowers. |
| `project-memory` | Formats and rules for ROADMAP / DECISIONS / DEFERRALS. |

## Hooks

One conditional `SessionStart` hook: injects ~60 words of flow context, but only
in repos that use the flow (`docs/theforge/` or `.theforge/` exists). Everywhere
else it emits nothing. Skill discovery doesn't depend on it — frontmatter
descriptions handle that in every session.

## Install

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add ~/development/theforge
claude plugin install theforge@theforge-local
```

After editing skills in this repo, reinstall (or re-add the marketplace) to pick
up changes.

## What was cut from superpowers and why

See `docs/notes/superpowers-assessment.md` — the full skill-by-skill assessment.
Headlines: plans no longer embed implementation code (the single biggest token
sink), per-task review is proportional instead of three agents per task, and the
800-word every-session hook injection is gone.
