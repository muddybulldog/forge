"""forge_dispose — the shared cross-harness review-finding decision helper.

Pure decision logic, extracted from forge-run.py (Phase 12b): verdict parsing,
provenance verification against the actual diff, the disposition matrix
(fix/defer/halt), and convergence-based rework/halt/pass decisions across
attempts. Contains no dispatch, no fixing, no committing, no file writes to
project docs — it takes reviewer output and diff text in, returns a decision.
The Codex runner (forge-run.py) calls these functions in-process; the Claude
dispatch path calls the same logic via this module's CLI (``main`` below) —
one tested implementation, two callers, so the decision is identical on both
harnesses regardless of who acts on it.

Imported as a plain module (not via importlib) so ``sys.modules`` caches one
instance and ``Finding``/``Verdict`` keep a single class identity across
forge-run.py and this module — the same discipline forge_git/forge_plan/
forge_receipts follow (DECISIONS 2026-07-14).
