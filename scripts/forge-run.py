"""forge-run.py — deterministic whole-plan task runner over ``codex exec``.

Scope: the sequential task loop (dependency order), worker dispatch via one
``codex exec`` process per task, direct acceptance-command execution, standard/
complex reviewer dispatch with a machine-parsed JSON verdict, the 2-iteration
rework cap enforced as a loop counter, mechanical halt on escalation, resume
(skip tasks already ``passed`` in the run-dir), a plan-level final review against
the whole-plan diff + spec, JSON receipts, a ``run.json`` summary, and plan-
checkbox ledger annotations.

Usage:
    forge-run.py <plan.md> --spec <spec.md> [--run-dir DIR] [--codex-bin PATH]

Exit codes:
    0  every task passed
    1  contract/usage error (malformed plan, brief generation failure,
       review-packet generation failure, unparseable reviewer verdict,
       reviewer process crash)
    2  halted on an escalated task

Structure: this module owns dispatch, review, the per-task rework loop, the plan
loop, and the CLI. Its supporting concerns live in sibling modules, imported
below and re-exported into this namespace (the test suite and ``codex-execution``
docs address them as ``forge_run.<name>``):
    forge_common    — dataclasses, tier/effort constants, ``eb``/``rp`` loaders
    forge_plan      — plan parsing, task ordering, effort-override parsing
    forge_git       — git helpers + review-packet assembly
    forge_receipts  — receipts, run.json, plan-checkbox ledger

Reuses ``extract-brief.py``/``review-packet.py`` (via forge_common) for all
plan/spec parsing and packet assembly — no duplicated heading grammar. Tier ->
model/effort mapping lives in exactly one table (``TIER_MAP``). All parse
failures raise loudly naming the cause (DECISIONS 2026-07-11); ``ultra``
reasoning effort is never emitted (DECISIONS 2026-07-13).
