"""forge_common — shared foundation for forge-run.py and its helper modules.

Holds the runner's dataclasses, the tier/effort/contract constants (each with a
single update point), and the two hyphenated sibling scripts (``extract-brief``,
``review-packet``) loaded once via importlib and re-exported as ``eb``/``rp`` so
every module shares one instance. Imported as a plain module (``import
forge_common``) so ``sys.modules`` caches a single object — dataclass identity is
preserved across forge_plan/forge_git/forge_receipts and the test suite.
