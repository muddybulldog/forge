# Running plan execution on Codex CLI

Claude Code executes a plan natively — in-session tier-worker dispatch, native
worktrees, code review, and verification to lean on. Codex CLI has none of
those, so on Codex forge *supplies the execution layer itself*: a
deterministic runner in place of in-session dispatch, foreground halt-relay in
place of native session awareness, explicit per-task commits, and a live
monitor. The flow, gates, and tiers are identical across both harnesses —
only the execution substrate differs. See
[The execution loop](execution-loop.md) for the review/classify/fix/defer/halt
model both harnesses implement, and
[`skills/planning/codex-execution.md`](../../skills/planning/codex-execution.md)
for the full invocation contract, halt/resume semantics, and the
orchestrator's reduced role.

## Invocation

```bash
python3 "$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/forge-run.py" <plan.md> --spec <spec.md> --timeout 900
```

That single call is whole-plan scope. The runner owns the task loop, brief
generation, worker dispatch, acceptance-command execution, review dispatch,
the convergence-based rework loop, receipts, and plan-checkbox ledger
annotations.

**Precondition:** requires a clean working tree at start —
`git status --porcelain` empty, with `.forge/` self-ignored. A dirty tree
causes a contract error (exit 1) naming the dirty paths; commit or discard
before re-invoking.

**`--autofix auto | gate`** (default `auto`): `auto` runs the disposition
matrix — fixes in-diff contract-breaking findings in-loop, defers
improvements, halts only genuine scope decisions. `gate` is the conservative
escape hatch — any finding halts for a human, no auto-fix.

**Per-task commits:** after each task passes, the runner stages all changes
and commits with message `forge: task N — <title>`, giving a clean checkpoint
after every passed task. `.forge/` is never staged. Escalated tasks commit
nothing — uncommitted work stays for human resolution.

## Session awareness — run in the foreground

Foreground is what makes a halt visible: the orchestrator is blocked on the
command, so when the runner exits non-zero (escalation exit 2, contract error
exit 1) it reads the receipt and relays the halt into the conversation —
"task N escalated, needs your decision." `--timeout 900` bounds every
`codex exec` call, so a genuinely hung task is killed and escalated rather
than sitting forever. Don't background-and-walk-away — that reintroduces the
blindness this mechanism exists to prevent.

Peek at any run on demand (dispatches nothing, exits 0):

```bash
python3 "$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/forge-run.py" --status --run-dir .forge/runs/<name>
```

## Live monitor (optional)

For a live view, run the monitor in a second terminal — a full-screen `rich`
TUI showing the plan ledger with the in-flight task lit, that task's
`codex exec` output scrolling, and a full-width banner when the run completes
or halts. The recommended shape is a **standing monitor**: leave it open once
and it attaches to every run.

```bash
sh .forge/watch      # standing monitor (forge-monitor.py --follow); the runner prints this at start
```

`--follow` watches the newest run and auto-flips to each new run as it
starts. One-shot forms also exist: `forge-monitor.py --latest` (newest run,
then exit) or `--run-dir .forge/runs/<name>`. It only reads the run dir
(dispatches nothing) and needs `rich` (`pip install rich`; on a
PEP-668-managed Python use `--break-system-packages` or a venv); a killed
runner shows as `stalled?` rather than a stuck spinner. `--status` above
stays the zero-dependency peek.

Receipts land in `.forge/runs/<timestamp>/`, uncommitted — the runner writes
a self-ignoring `.forge/.gitignore` (`*`) on first run, so there's no
target-repo setup.

## Known Codex caveats

These apply to ad-hoc in-session Codex subagents (exploration, one-off
review) — the only place forge still spawns them. Plan execution goes
through `forge-run.py`'s one-`codex exec`-process-per-task instead, which
sidesteps both issues by construction (no parent-model inheritance, no
completed-worker accumulation).

- Subagent selection has known regressions (custom-agent selection broke in
  v0.137.0 and spawned agents silently inherited the parent model). If
  spawned agents run the wrong model, check acceptance-command output rather
  than trusting the spawn.
- Spawned subagents pile up in the CLI's agent list, and completed workers
  keep counting against the thread limit
