# Visual Companion Guide

Browser-based companion for showing mockups, diagrams, and visual options during
brainstorming. **Display-only:** the browser shows; all conversation — reactions,
choices, direction — happens in the terminal.

## When to use

Decide per-question, not per-session. The test: **would the user understand this
better by seeing it than reading it?**

**Use the browser** when the content itself is visual: UI mockups and wireframes,
layout or design-direction comparisons, architecture diagrams, state machines and
flowcharts, look-and-feel questions.

**Use the terminal** when the content is text: requirements and scope, conceptual
A/B/C choices, trade-off lists, API and data-model decisions. A question *about*
a UI topic is not automatically visual — "what should the wizard do?" is
conceptual (terminal); "which of these wizard layouts feels right?" is visual
(browser).

## The refinement checkpoint

Visuals follow the same rhythm as the rest of brainstorming — but the user
decides when they're done, and your job is to *ask*, not to assume either way:

1. **Present** — write a mockup (or several variants side by side) to `screen_dir`;
   the browser refreshes automatically.
2. **Discuss in the terminal** — the user reacts in the CLI, never by clicking.
3. **Checkpoint on selection** — when the user picks a direction, do not start
   building. Ask: *"Option A it is — want to refine it further or go deeper on
   that direction, or is this good enough to fold into the design?"*
4. **Their answer decides** — "refine" means apply the feedback, present the
   updated mockup, and return to step 2 (ask again after). "We're good" means
   fold the visual into the design and move on.

The checkpoint hands the user the brake: they get an explicit moment to say
"nah, we're good" — or to keep going. The failure mode this prevents is jumping
from "user picked an option" straight to building without asking.

## How it works

The server watches a directory and serves the newest `.html` file to the browser,
auto-reloading on changes. You write HTML to `screen_dir`; the user watches it
evolve.

**Fragments vs. full documents:** if your file starts with `<!DOCTYPE` or
`<html`, it's served as-is. Otherwise it's wrapped in the frame template (header,
OS-aware light/dark theme, layout CSS). **Write fragments by default** — the
frame provides `.options`/`.option` (lettered choice rows), `.cards`/`.card`,
`.mockup`, `.split` (side-by-side), `.pros-cons`, `.placeholder`, and `.mock-*`
elements for quick wireframes.

## Starting a session

```bash
# From this skill's scripts/ directory — always pass the project root
scripts/start-server.sh --project-dir /path/to/project

# Returns: {"type":"server-started","port":52341,"url":"http://localhost:52341",
#           "screen_dir":".../.forge/brainstorm/<session>/content",
#           "state_dir":".../.forge/brainstorm/<session>/state"}
```

Save `screen_dir` from the response and tell the user to open the URL. With
`--project-dir`, mockups persist in `.forge/brainstorm/` (gitignored; the
`.forge/` directory also serves as the forge session-hook opt-in signal).
Without it, files go to `/tmp` and are cleaned up. If you launched in the
background and lost the startup JSON, read `state_dir/server-info`.

Remote/container environments: add `--host 0.0.0.0` (and `--url-host <name>` to
control the displayed hostname). If background processes get reaped, rerun with
`--foreground` in a persistent terminal.

## Stopping

```bash
scripts/stop-server.sh <session_dir>   # or let it die: 30-min idle timeout, or owner-exit detection
```

Project-dir sessions keep their mockup files after the server stops — useful as
input to the spec.
